# Epion Loxone integration

Integrate the CO2 concentration measurements of an Epion Air CO2 sensor into your Loxone system. The Epion Air CO2 sensor communicates via WiFi and can easily be included into existing installations.
The Epion Air sensor registers the CO2 concentration, temperature and humidity in the room and transmits these via WiFi. With the Loxone integration, you can incorporate these measurements into your Loxone system to for instance drive the ventilation system.



As the Epion Air communicates via WiFi, there is no need for additional wiring to the Miniserver, making it simple to incorporate into an existing system. In the installation guide we have included several example integrations that may be used.
